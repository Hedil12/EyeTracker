Recording the movement and size of eyes to track and logged it

Supposed workflow:
LLM using RAG framework taking in documentations and research on the heat-related illnesses symptoms with eyes
Create a prompt surrounding that.
Logs record the pupils movements while the RAG model identifies the pupils movement base on time differences
and evaluate the diagnosis
